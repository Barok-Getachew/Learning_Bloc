<!-- streams
=>streams are a source of asynchronous events delivered sequentially. There are data events, which are sometimes referred to as elements of the stream due to a streamâ€™s similarity to a list, and there are error events, which are notifications of failure. Once all data elements have been emitted, a special event signaling the stream is done will notify any listeners that there is no more.                                                                                                                  
=> our illustration to understand streams are a choclate factory
 order taker
in real this is a part to add the event/value/ object in to a stream
by using streamcontroller.add function we can add values to a stream
order inspector
map function of a stream will watch out every values in the stream and do some processing on it.
in this part will take the only wanted attribute of the passed value(object)
baker
there is a transformer which maked the actual operation on the object and the add in to the stream again

finally listen functiuon
is a function to listen what is changed in the strean and show a change

Bloc Pattern
=> it is a pattern based on stream of events . 
=> there is event producing widgets and evnet consuming widgets

 -->

Scalable
organized
structured
Maintainable

# Chapter one:Why Blcc?
Bloc is a design pattern developed by google to separate the presentation layer with the data layer
# **Advantage**
> better understading of our own apps
> more structured code,easier to maintain and test
> know every state of the applicatiom
> it have a single code base.


# Chapter 2- Bloc core concepts

## STREAMS
== async*  asynchronus data generating function
== yield it pushes the data to the stream
== await helps for waiting the process to finish
this is foundationn of bloc
this a very crucial in the concept of bloc becuase we have to catch every event happened in the ui so we cam handle the state properly.

## Cubit
it is a special type of stream component
bloc extebs cubit
based on some function called from the ui  function to  rebuild the ui by emitting diffrent state on the stram
class CounterCubit extends Cubit<int>{
    CounterCubit:super(0)

    void increament()=>emit(state+1)
    void decreament()=>emit(state-1)

}

=> Cubit functions are not a part of a stream. they are simply pre made list of what  a cubit can do
=> the one and only stream found in cubit is the stream of emitted state


## BLOC
it recives a stream of events and release a stream of state


# Flutter BLoc Concept

1. Bloc Provider
    It will provide a single a single instance of a bloc to the subtree bellow it......it also called dependency injecttion
    responsible for closing the bloc
    it instantiates the bloc lazely meaning it is created when it is needed
    BlocProvider.create() to instantiate the bloc
    BlocProvider.value()== toi pass the on;ly instantiated bloc to another context

2. Bloc Builder
    It is a widget that helps rebuilding the ui based on the state changes
    it requires a bloc or a cubit and it have a builder function
3. Bloc Listner


4 Bloc Consumer


5. Repository provider
